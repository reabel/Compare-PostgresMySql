###  Using MySQL in I-Sight

<!-- Original email:
Here are my rough talking points for what I’d like to talk about regarding MySQL at devcon:

 

- Brushing up, what’s new to MySQL: Discussion about features brought out with 8.0 and on (show some of the more relevant features).

- MySQL vs Postgres: Transition from MySQL 8.0 discussion into comparison of features with that of Postgres.

- Using MySQL in I-Sight: discussing initial configuration of SQL locally, and issues that might happen during deployment, but mostly a demo of how MySQL features can/might be used.

 

The main Idea would be to follow a few prominent features from the beginning point to the end, adding / removing parts when necessary to fit within time contraints.
